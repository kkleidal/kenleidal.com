In June 2017, I graduated from MIT with a B.S. in computer science and
engineering and a minor in mathematics. I finished with a 5.0 GPA.

I am currently enrolled in a year-long M.Eng. program at MIT, concentrating
  in AI/ML.
My research concerns speech recognition and understanding.
I recently
  published my first paper as first author:
  [Learning Modality-Invariant Representations of Speech and Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03897).

In addition, I am working with two of my classmates on a startup:
  [Posh Development, LLC](https://poshdevelopment.com).
Our goal is to design a system which makes it easy for companies
  to launch rule-based chatbots for costumer service automation.
We are currently working on patenting a LISP-based programming language
  I invented which sits at the heart of our system.
When I graduate in June, I plan to work on Posh full-time.

  - Designed and led a team of researchers in implementing an
    extensible Python framework for
    configuring a graph of modular components
    for processing live-streamed multimodal data (speech and images)
  - Researched unsupervised concept learning from joint embedding
    spaces learned from paired multimodal sensory data
- **Quipu GmbH** Intern
  - June, 2015 - August 2015. Frankfurt, Germany
  - Explored the use of basic NLP techniques in analyzing issue reports from Quipu's clients
